The code is a port from the original in MatLab (https://github.com/frcs/colour-transfer).
Pictures used in the examples are taken from the original project at (https://github.com/frcs/colour-transfer) and were released free of copyrigths. 
Please, cite their publications when using this code and pictures.

This module contains also a Python implementation of the Linear Monge-Kantorovitch color rotation transformation.

The idea behind this implementation is to apply the colour mapping techniques to the transformation of galaxy colors in simulated catalogs to better reproduce the observed distributions.
